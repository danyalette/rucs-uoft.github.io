<p>

Welcome to the 2017 edition of RUCS. We are now accepting extended abstracts for submission! The deadline for submission is August 18th (Early Submission [ES]) and August 25th for regular consideration.  For ES, we will notify authors on a rolling basis (but no later than August 25th). For regular consideration, we will notify authors by September 3rd.
Please consider ES, as there are four possible decisions, two of which will take extra time: <br>

    <ol>
    <li>
        Accept
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        Major Revision
    </li>
    <li>
        Reject
    </li>
    </ol>


More detailed instructions on submissions can be found in this <a href = https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yVDTbjVuExxzBVFIVpzssB97J2ogHBYiSeqpDMJH_JU/edit?usp=sharing> document</a>
<br> <br>

Special note: starting this year, we will be recognizing the best abstracts in each category with honorary titles and awards!
There will also be an <b> extra special </b> mention for best abstract overall as well as best use of infographics.

<br>
Addendum: also, we will be offering assistance with creation of infographics. Please indicate interest when submitting.

<br>
If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail us at rucs@cs.toronto.edu with any questions!

<br>
Sincerely,<br>
the RUCS 2017 Team
