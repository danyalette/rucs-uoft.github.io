Introduction

N-way matching consists of finding correspondences between elements of
multiple inputs. It is useful in many software engineering practices
like merging branches of a software configuration management
system. [3] Creating an n-way match boils down to
identifying groups of elements from distinct inputs that are similar to
each other, i.e., that share properties [6].

Figure 1 shows an example of matching elements from
inputs $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$. The dotted and solid lines represent two
different matching options. Paired elements share more properties in the
match represented by the solid lines than those in the match represented
by the dotted lines. Finding an optimal n-way match is straightforward
for simple examples, yet finding an optimal match for larger cases has
been shown to be NP-hard; that is, there is no algorithm that produces
the optimal solution in polynomial time. This makes n-way matching
infeasible to automate [6].

Thus far, it has been the approach to develop heuristic algorithms that
approximate the optimal solution in polynomial
time [6]. This paper explores an alternative
direction for establishing n-way matches. Our approach is inspired by
the idea of *games with a purpose*, which crowd-source a solution to a
computationally expensive problem by encoding it into a game for people
to play [8].

Approach
========

Our game, <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">MatchMakers</span></span>, uses
people’s abilities to perform visual comparisons in a fast and efficient
manner [4, 7]. We encode elements of inputs as
aliens. 

For example, Figure 2 shows aliens that
represent elements in Figure 1. Input elements that
share more properties are more visually similar. The goal of the player
is to help the aliens form “groups of friends”, i.e., to create groups
of visually similar aliens.

The game starts from the best solution so far – either the solution
produced by the best heuristic algorithm, or by a previous player that
has improved that solution. A player begins by being presented an alien
for whom they must form a group. The rest of the aliens are displayed
below, each within its own group. Aliens that are similar to the ones in
the group being formed are highlighted, making for less overwhelming
in-game decisions. If a player manages to form a group of aliens which
causes the score of the solution to increase, then that solution is
saved, and the player restarts the game with a new alien. An example of
the game layout is shown in Figure 2.

In order for people to have the greatest chance at improving the score,
we aim to provide good game support. We want to implement an effective
highlighting strategy, i.e., a strategy that is general enough so that
players are not missing good aliens to add their group, but also
specific enough so that the game is not overwhelming. We also want to
figure out how to best pick the alien from which players start forming a
group. If players are presented with aliens that are difficult to group,
they might become exhausted and stop playing the game.

In order to speed up the evaluation of the different game
configurations, as well as identify whether it is feasible for players
to improve the solutions formed by the best heuristic algorithm, we
first built an automated algorithm that simulates a human player. This
algorithm is referred to as <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">HSim</span></span>. Based on the
configuration that results in the best scores over a large number of
real world case studies, we set the design of the game and approximated
the success that players might expect to achieve.

Analysis
========

We tested <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">HSim</span></span>with four different
configuration parameters: *highlighting*, *ordering*, *reshuffling*, and
*selecting*. *Highlighting* is as described in Section 2. *Ordering*
defines the order in which aliens are presented for grouping.
*Reshuffling* defines whether we reorder the aliens for grouping every
time a player manages to improve the score. *Selecting* assigns a
strategy for choosing which aliens to append to the current group. This
is the only configuration parameter which does not have an influence on
game design, but affects <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">HSim</span></span>’s ability to improve
the heuristic scores. The conceptual design of the human simulator is
shown in Algorithm 1.

We used 4 highlighting strategies, 7 ordering strategies, 3 reshuffling
strategies, and 2 selecting strategies, for a total of 168 different
variants of <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">HSim</span></span>. As case studies, we
used 15 examples taken from existing work on n-way
matching [6, 5, 2].

The best configuration of <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">HSim</span></span>results in an average
improvement of 9.3% over the solutions of the best heuristic algorithm.
To test whether this is a significant improvement, we performed a paired
t-test using PROC TTEST in SAS [1]. We ran this test because our data
consisted of paired observations for the two algorithms over the 15
different cases. The null hypothesis for the t-test was that the two
data sets for the different algorithms came from the same underlying
distribution. The t-test returned a p-value of 0.0019, which is less
than 0.05, rejecting the null hypothesis and signifying that <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">HSim</span></span> was able to make a
significant improvement over the solutions found by the best heuristic
algorithm.

Conclusion
==========

In this paper, we reported on our experience designing <span><span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">MatchMakers</span></span>– a game for
solving the n-way match problem. We identified a number of strategies
regarding how the game could support human players in making better
choices and experimented with an automated simulator to help select the
most effective ones for the game. Furthermore, we have proven that,
given a fairly simple strategy for choosing elements to append to a
given group, an automated version of a human player is able to
significantly improve the scores achieved by the best heuristic
algorithm [6].

In the future, we would like to conduct a study with real human players
to assess whether they are also able to significantly improve the
solutions achieved by the best heuristic algorithms for n-way matching,
as well as how they compare to our naive implementation of a human
player. We also hope to redesign the human simulator to employ more
intelligent strategies for finding an n-way match in hopes of improving
its performance.
