1 Introduction
===

This project explores Partial Differential Equation (PDE)

discretization methods
for discontinuous coefficient PDEs,
with application to a mathematical model simulating
the invasion of brain cancer (glioma). This model involves
a PDE with discontinuous diffusion coefficient
due to the heterogeneous nature of the brain,
consisting of white and grey matters.

PDEs are ubiquitous in modeling many physical phenomena.
Phenomena that involve diffusion (scattering) and reaction
(e.g. proliferation)
are often modelled by the so-called $reaction-diffusion$ PDEs.
Such PDEs are pertinent to cancer growth,
as the latter involves scattering and proliferation of cancerous cells.

Physical problems that involve unknown quantities that
are evolving in time (and vary along spacial dimensions)
are modelled by time-dependent PDEs.
These PDEs, together with equations describing
the initial state (referred to as $initial$ $conditions$),
and equations describing the boundary behaviour of the unknown 
(referred to as $boundary$ $conditions$),
form an $Initial$ $Value$ $Problem$ (IVP).
On the other hand, if the unknown quantities
vary only along spacial dimensions,
the PDEs together with boundary conditions
form a $Boundary$ $Value$ $Problem$ (BVP).

Often, PDEs cannot be solved by analytic methods.
In such cases, numerical methods are employed for the PDE solution.
The numerical solution involves two main steps:
the conversion of the continuous problem
into a set of discrete algebraic equations, referred to
as $discretization$,
and the solution of the arising set of equations
(often a linear system of equations),
which results in discrete approximate values of
the unknown quantities or other related discrete values.
The size of the system of equations depends
on the number of discrete points/data ($discretization points$)
taken in the domain of the problem.
The discretization method is critical for the accuracy
of the solution, as well as for the correctness of the solution,
in the sense of satisfying any special conditions or constraints
arising from the problem.
A discretization method should $converge$,
in the sense of the approximate solution values converging
to the exact ones, as the number of discretization points
increases. Faster convergence (i.e. a higher $order$ $of$ $convergence$) is desirable.

The partial derivatives occurring in a PDE
often appear with coefficient functions.
Standard numerical PDE methods normally assume
continuous coefficient functions. However, when
these discretization methods are applied to
a discontinuous coefficient PDE,
convergence of the approximate solution,
as the number of discretization points increases,
is not guaranteed.
Studying numerical methods for PDEs with discontinuous coefficients
is pertinent to brain cancer growth,
as it is known that the brain consists mainly
of grey and white matter, and the diffusion rate
(represented by a coefficient function) is
higher in the white than in the grey matter.

In previous studies, some researchers formulated Hermite spline collocation methods 
for discontinuous diffusion PDEs [1][2],
using a clever adjustment
of the basis functions to satisfy certain constraints
resulting from the discontinuity of the coefficient. 
In [3], quadratic spline collocation methods are used, and
in [4], adaptive Hermite spline collocation is formulated
for the same problem, with a clever approximation
of the discontinuous diffusion coefficient.
In all these works, the expected (fourth) order of convergence
is obtained.

Finite Difference (FD) methods (approximating derivatives
by linear combinations of discrete function values)
are popular and flexible discretization methods for PDEs.
We propose two approaches to adjust the standard
FD methods,
so that the numerical solution satisfies the
constraints resulting from the discontinuity of the coefficient,
and converges with the expected order of convergence.

In Section 2, we present the problems considered.
In Section 3, we describe the numerical methods developed,
in particular regarding discontinuous diffusion,
and in Section 4, we demonstrate results from numerical experiments
that show the effectiveness of our methods.
We conclude in Section 5.

2 Discontinuous Diffusion PDE
===

The PDE under consideration is the Reaction-Diffusion PDE
in one spatial dimension
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:IVP}
u_t = (d(x)u_x)_x + \rho u + f(x, t) \equiv \mathcal{L}u + f(x, t), ~
\mbox{in} ~ [a, b] \times (0, t_f), (1)
\end{equation}
where $u(x,t)$ is unknown quantity
dependent on $x$ (spatial coordinate) and $t$ (time),
which diffuses (spreads around) with diffusion coefficient $d(x)$
and grows (proliferates or reacts) with coefficient $\rho$.
Given the initial (at time $t = 0$) state of $u$, and
some conditions at the boundary of the spatial domain,
we want to predict the state at some given final time $t = t_f$.
PDE (1), together with these initial and boundary conditions,
forms an IVP.

(In most realistic problems,
the forcing term $f(x, t)$ is equal to zero,
but we may set it to non-zero for the purpose
of certain numerical experiments.)

In the mathematical model for the density
of tumoral cells in the brain of a patient,
considered in [5],
the non-homogeneity
of brain (grey and white matter, reflected in the discontinuity 
of the diffusion coefficient) is modelled as

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img align="middle" style="margin:50"  height="50%" width="50%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/J.Yao/math1.png"/>
</p>

For simplicity, the two values of the diffusion coefficient
in the white and grey matter are set as follows:
Let $D_w=1$ and $D_g = \gamma$ where $\gamma = \frac{D_g}{D_w} < 1$
is a parameter chosen by the user.
Assume, for simplicity, two interfaces: from left to right,
$w_1$ (grey to white) and $w_2$ (white to grey).
See Figure 1.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:0.95rem"><b>Figure 1: </b>diffusion coefficient $d(x)$ as it varies with $x$.</p>

The presence of the discontinuity in the diffusion coefficient
results in a certain type of (dis-)continuity conditions
across interfaces modelled as

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img align="middle" style="margin:50" height="75%" width="75%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/J.Yao/math3.PNG"/>
</p>

Since the discontinuities occur along the space dimension,
we also consider a BVP,
described by the PDE

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img align="middle" style="margin:50" height="75%" width="75%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/J.Yao/math4.PNG"/>
</p>

where the solution $u(x)$ satisfies (dis-)continuity conditions
similar to (1)-(2),
and boundary conditions similar to those
the solution of (1) satisfies.

The space discretization techniques are easier to describe for the BVP than for the IVP. For this reason, we focus on the description of the space discretization techniques for the BVP in detail, and these techniques can be applied to the IVP.

3 Numerical Methods
===

consider the space discretization of PDE (5).
We discretize the spatial domain as shown in Figure 2.

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img align="middle" style="margin:50" height="75%" width="75%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/J.Yao/math5.PNG"/>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:0.95rem"><b>Figure 2: </b>Domain discretization</p>

For simplicity, we use uniform discretization.
Let $x_0=a$, $x_i = a+ih_x~(i=1,\dots, N)$, $N=N_1+N_2+N_3$ and
$h_x=\frac{b-a}{N}$. Also for simplicity,
assume that $w_1 = x_{N_1} = x_k, w_2=x_{N_1+N_2}$ and $u(x_i)$ = $u_i$.
Note that $N$ is the total number of subintervals
and $N+1$ the total number of discretization points
including boundary.

Two approaches were developed in the project to deal
with discontinuous diffusion.

$Approach$ $1$

We treat the PDE as multi-domain problem
with individual respective approximations for each subdomain,
and use the interface conditions as "boundary" conditions
for the subdomain problems.
Specifically, the equations used at the interface points are:


<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img align="middle" style="margin:50" height="75%" width="75%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/J.Yao/math6.PNG"/>
</p>

Discretizing each term of equation (6) by one-sided FDs and taking into account (2) results in

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img align="middle" style="margin:50" height="75%" width="75%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/J.Yao/math7.PNG"/>
</p>

Note that, for non-interface points, we use the standard equations

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img align="middle" style="margin:50" height="75%" width="75%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/J.Yao/math8.PNG"/>
</p>

discretized by standard second-order FDs.

$Approach$ $2$

For all non-interface points,
we use the same space discretization
as in the first approach.
For the interface points, we establish equations to relate
%the limits of the functional and forcing terms from both sides
the limits of the PDE terms from both sides
of the interface point. The equations used at the interface points are:

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img align="middle" style="margin:50" height="75%" width="75%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/J.Yao/math9.PNG"/>
</p>

To discretize equation (9),
we form one-sided stencils that involve $u_{xx}$ and $u_x$,
take a linear combination of them so that the $u_x$ terms
are cancelled using the discontinuity condition (3),
while condition (2) is also taken into account,
then add appropriate terms to form $\mathcal{L}u(w_1^-)$
and $\mathcal{L}u(w_1^+)$. Then we get

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img align="middle" style="margin:50" height="75%" width="75%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/J.Yao/math10.PNG"/>
</p>

In the above relation, the term
$f(w_1^-) + f(w_1^+)$ is approximated by
$f(w_1-\epsilon) + f(w_1+\epsilon)$,
for a suitably small $\epsilon > 0$.
Relation (10) is discretized similarly.

Following a similar derivation, the proposed space discretization methods
can be extended to fourth-order accuracy
(error in spatial discretization is $O(h_x^4)$),
for both the interface and non-interface points.

Coming back to (1),
for the time discretization, we adopt the standard Crank-Nicolson
timestepping scheme, with $\Delta t \propto h_x$,
and, for the space discretization, the techniques
we described for the PDE (5).

4 Numerical Results
===

We first test the proposed space discretization schemes
on a BVP, then extend them to IVPs.
In all problems, we used $\gamma = 0.20$, $\rho = 1$,
$a = -5$ and $b = -a$.
In Problems 1 and 2, $w_1 = -0.5$, $w_2 = -w_1$, and
in Problem 3, $w_1 = 0$ and $w_2 = 2$.

In Problem 1, we pick a function $u$ that satisfies the interface conditions
and take its gradients as defined in $\mathcal{L}u$
to form the non-zero forcing term $f(x)$.
Then, Problem 1 is a BVP with a known solution,
guaranteed to satisfy the interface conditions.
When we apply each of our approaches to Problem 1,
we obtain respective approximate solutions
that can be compared to the (known) exact one.
Such a problem can be used as a benchmark
to evaluate the accuracy of our computed approximate solutions.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:0.95rem"><b>Figure 3: </b>Plot of error versus the total number of subintervals $N$ for Problem 1.
For Approach 2, $\epsilon = 10^{-10}$.</p>

In Figure 3,the error of the computed solution decreases in the expected order:
when the number of discretization points is doubled, the error
becomes approximately 4 times smaller for the second-order method
and 16 times smaller for the fourth-order method.
The slope of the error plots indicates the (negative) order of convergence.

Problem 2 is an IVP with exact solution known,
and a non-zero forcing term $f(x,t)$
formed according to PDE (1).
The solution satisfies the interface conditions at all points in time and
the state of $u$ at $t=0$ is given as the initial condition.
Again, as in Problem 1, we compute approximate solutions
by our approaches and compare them to the (known) exact one.


<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img align="middle" style="margin:50" height="75%" width="75%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/J.Yao/convg_Uno104_IVP-eps-converted-to-1.png"/>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:0.95rem"><b>Figure 4: </b>Plot of maximum error among all points in time versus $N$ for Problem 2.
For Approach 2, $\epsilon = 10^{-10}$.</p>

In Figure 4, the error decreasing trend is similar to the BVP case.
The convergence results match the expected ones.

Problem 3 is an IVP with exact solution unknown,
and a zero forcing term $f(x,t)$.
The initial condition satisfies the interface conditions.

While, as mentioned in the Introduction,
other researchers managed to obtain
fourth-order methods for the same problem,
we did this by employing the simpler, more flexible
and more widely used Finite Difference methods.

Note that both the proposed methods can be generalized to more interfaces,
and to non-uniform grid discretizations.
We also plan to consider adaptive FD methods and
extension to multiple space dimensions.
