Introduction
============

Video data, such as movies, consists of multi-source media and is a rich
source of information. The complex features in video data are difficult,
but interesting, to analyze. Due to the significant advances in the
field of computer vision, we can now effectively track people and label
their actions in videos [5]. Recent work has started to
tackle a high-level semantic understanding of videos such as reasoning
about the plot, mood and motivation of the characters in
movies [8, 6]. 

The goal of our work is to identify
characters in movies. Character identification plays an important role
in the semantic understanding of stories [5]. For example, in
order to understand a movie plot, one first needs to know who everyone
is in every scene. In this paper, we focus on training a Siamese
convolutional neural network (CNN) model for character identification in
the MovieQA dataset [6]. In particular, our method scores each face
track in a movie against a set of images of actors playing the main
characters using a Siamese CNN.

Approach
========

In this paper, we aim to identify faces in movies from the MovieQA
dataset which aims to evaluate automatic story comprehension [6].
We extracted each movie’s cast list and actors’ photos from IMDb, an
online resource for movies (<http://www.imdb.com/>). Since actor photos
typically contain the full person, we first performed face detection on
each image, which is explained in more detail in Sec. 2.1.
We cropped an image of the face from each detection. Our goal was to
compare images in each face track to face crops from actors photos, and
assign the most similar actor to each face track. In this abstract, we
implement a Siamese convolutional neural network to solve the face
identification problem, which we describe in Sec. 2.2.
Finally, we explain how we apply our Siamese convolutional neural
network to our movie data in Sec. 2.3.

### Face Detection in IMDb data 

We employ Xiangxin Zhu’s face detector [7] to perform face detection
on the photos extracted from IMDb. Zhu’s algorithm detects facial
landmarks using probabilistic models based on the concept of mixture of
trees [7]. It was trained on the annotated facial landmarks in the
wild (AFLW) data set [2]. 

Zhu’s algorithm achieved good results on the
IMDb data. However, the algorithm could occasionally make small mistakes
like missing small faces or faces in oblique poses (poor performing
examples are shown in Figure 3). We lowered the default threshold to
allow more detections through. This aimed to ensure that each face was
detected, but could result in false positives. To deal with this, we
built a face/non-face classifier using more powerful features. In
particular, we used a CNN with the architecture from [3]. 

We
trained the classifier on the AFLW data set. The AFLW data set contains
many facial images and their corresponding bounding boxes. We wanted to
generate some data with face/non-face labels. Therefore, we made random
crops from the original AFLW’s images. These were labeled as positive
face examples if their intersection over union (IOU) with the original
bounding box was higher than 75%, and we labeled those with IOU under
25% as non-faces. We then employed the trained CNN network on face
detections from the IMDb data. Figure 4 contains some examples of our
combined models’ results.

Neural networks have became a hot topic due to their impressive success
in various fields and applications such as image search, speech
recognition, and language understanding. CNNs are a type of neural
network with local connectivity properties and efficient parameter
sharing achieved by their use of convolutions. They are particularly
well suited for image-related tasks. 

Traditional CNNs are often used in
classification problems; in our task, this would mean classifying each
image (in a face track) as one of the actors in the database. However,
building a simple classification CNN might not be feasible for our task
because it requires that all the classes be known in advance, and
assumes many examples are available per class. In our setting, new
actors can appear in every movie and each typically has only a few image
examples. Thus, we used the idea behind face verification approaches
that aim to take a pair of photos as input and predict whether they
belong to the same person or not.

The specific architecture that we
adopted was a Siamese network, which is often used in face verification
challenges [4, 1]. This kind of network is commonly used
where there is a large number of classes to train and/or not all
examples have been seen during training [1]. The idea is to pass each
of the two images, one from the face track and one from the actors’
database, through two CNNs which share all the parameters. The top layer
features from the two streams typically go through another set of fully
connected layers, finally solving our prediction task. 

The Siamese
network we built consists of two replicas of 2-conv-layer CNNs which are
used to extract features from the two image inputs. Absolute difference
of the features are passed to a fully connected layer which classifies
inputs into two classes: match and mismatch pairs. Our network closely
follows DeepFace’s [4] Siamese structure in which the weights are
trained by the standard cross entropy loss and back-propagation of the
error. We applied exponential decay to the learning rates and we also
normalized the pixel values of images to be in the range \[0,1\]. The
network’s structure is shown in Figure 1.

### Face Identification in Movies

We applied a detector-based multi-pose face tracker @KnockMakarand on
our movie data to get face tracks. The results are shown in Figure 2.
The tracker performed well on our movie data. We also applied our
Convolutional Neural Network from Sec. 2.2 to compare
actors’ photos’ face detection results for IMDb images 2.1
to our movie face track in order to identify characters being tracked in
each frame. We took the average score across all frames for each actor
and selected the actor with the highest average score as the character
identity for the face track.

Analysis 
========

In the following sections, we will discuss the major findings of our
project and demonstrate some results along the way.

### Face Detection

The face detection results on IMDb images are displayed in Figure 4. The
method generally works well on single-face images, but performance
fluctuates when there are multiple people in the images (shown in figure
3). Our face detection results improved significantly with the help of
our CNN face/non-face classifier, reaching 91% accuracy, 90% recall and
92% precision rate on our test images.

### Siamese Network

The Siamese network we built takes a long time to train. It is still in
the progress of training.

Conclusion and Future Work
==========================

We have introduced a method for identifying characters in movie data. We
are now building the Siamese convolutional neural network model which
would be used with actors’ photos extracted from IMDb to identify
characters in movies. The model is slowly coming together. 

There are
many directions we can pursue to create a better model for face
identification in movie data. One possible direction would be to
investigate a better loss function for our Siamese network. Another
direction is that we can take advantage in the richness of the
information in video data to help us improve our current model’s
performance. There is quite a bit of useful information from the movie
data that we did not explicitly model, including actor’s costumes, audio
tracks, and subtitles. Integrating these factors should make the model
more robust. Currently, our algorithm only gives similarity scores
between a pair of face images. However, we are using temporal data -
videos. An interesting future project may be to implement an algorithm
that provides similarity scores in face tracks.
