Introduction
============

Nerve damage or any kind of nerve impingement can halt the job of a
programmer until it heals. If it does not heal, then it can end their
career. Solutions have been attempted via voice recognition but they are
extremely rigid (i.e. one cannot customize the software to adapt to the
user), are proprietary, or are unable to be run or compiled due to
outdated or missing software/libraries. Therefore, to address these
issues, we developed software with the intent to use a free speech
recognition engine, that users can easily customize and become
productive in a short time.

Approach
========

The application was designed and a set of users volunteered to test the
software and provide feedback. In a preliminary trial, a group of five
users were asked to use the program after a few minutes of instruction.
Simple tasks such as coding an algorithm by voice or developing a simple
data type were requested if the users did not bring their own idea to
implement. Using what they learned, they carried the task out and after
30-60 minutes of usage, they were questioned on what they liked and
didnâ€™t like, and were asked for recommendations to the program.

Analysis
========

All of the users were impressed at the speed and easy usage of the
application. The only negatives that occurred (which was consistent
among all users) were:

1.  How the recognition engine would abort prematurely, and then start
    immediately processing the subsequent buffered text, yielding
    unexpected commands (likely due to the subsequent point).

2.  Voice detection requires the usage of trained software specific to
    the user, or else the recognition rate is too low and it becomes
    cumbersome to use the application.

3.  A default library of various languages should be provided as
    an option.

Conclusion
==========

The software is easy to use and, combined with a trained recognition
engine, can be just as effective as typing for large tasks. Users were
able to effectively utilize the program with very little instruction and
quickly create grammar definitions to yield solutions.
