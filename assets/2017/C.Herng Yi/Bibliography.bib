abstract="Overlapping domain decomposition methods are efficient and flexible. It is also important that such methods are inherently suitable for parallel computing. In this chapter, we will first explain the mathematical formulation and algorithmic composition of the overlapping domain decomposition methods. Afterwards, we will focus on a generic implementation framework and its applications within Diffpack.",

  abstract={We see how the relaxation method for Laplace's equation is related to a numerical solution of the heat equation, which is in turn motivated by thinking of the Hamiltonian as the the time evolution operator in quantum mechanics. This gives some physical insight into what the relaxation method is doing. We also use this to suggest investigative work for a student learning about computational methods in physics.}
