Introduction
===

The Laplace equation and Possion equation are partial differential equations (PDEs) which arise naturally from analyzing heat flow, Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, and shape recognition in computer graphics \cite{ShapeRepresentation}. We studied a new way to solve these equations on overlapping triangular mesh domains, in order to smoothen the computer animation of objects that are represented using those meshes. We designed several variants of a divide-and-conquer solution method, and tested them against each other for accuracy.
